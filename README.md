# Smart-home-security-system
The smart home security system secures the home by only unlocking the door by reading the fingerprint of the person.
The camera will capture the face of the person who tries to enter the house without valid fingerprint
The fingerprint scanner will be used to scan the fingerprint of the person.
The device will send the captured image of the person in the mail.
It is easy as there wont be any risk of loosing the door key or need to call the locksmith to maintain the doorlock.
