# Smart-home-security-system
The smart home security system secures the home by only unlocking the door by reading the fingerprint of the person.
There will be a camera which will capture the face of the person who tries to enter the house without valid fingerprint
The fingerprint scanner will be used to scan the fingerprint of the person.
The device will send the captured image of the person in the mail to the owner.
It is easy as there wont be any risk of loosing the door key or need to call the locksmith to maintain the doorlock.
Multiple fingerprint can be stored. Hence, if a person thumb finger has a cut he/ she can use index finger to unlock the door.
